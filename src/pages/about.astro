	<h1>My Astro Site</h1>
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

	<p>
		I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
		on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
	</p>

	<p>
		This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
		back and see how my journey is going!
